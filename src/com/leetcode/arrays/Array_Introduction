Array Introduction
What Is an Array?
-------------------------
An Array is a collection of similar items. items are stored in the contiguous 
memory location.

Creating an Array
-------------------------
Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you.
In Java, we use the following code to create an Array to hold up to 15 DVDs. 
Note that we've also included a simple definition of a DVD for clarity.
// The actual code for creating an Array to hold DVD's.
DVD[] dvdCollection = new DVD[15];

// A simple definition for a DVD.
public class DVD {
    public String name;
    public int releaseYear;
    public String director;

    public DVD(String name, int releaseYear, String director) {
        this.name = name;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.director = director;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", directed by " + this.director + ", released in " + this.releaseYear;
    }
}

Accessing Elements in Arrays
-------------------------------------
Writing Items into an Array--
To put a DVD into the Array, we need to decide which of the 15 places we'd like it to go in. Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of 0 to N - 1.
The 1st place is 0, the 2nd place is 1, the 3rd place is 2... all the way up to the 15th place, which is 14.
We call these numbers that identify each place indexes.

// Firstly, we need to actually create a DVD object for The Avengers.
DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("The Avengers", 2012, "Joss Whedon");

// Next, we'll put it into the 8th place of the Array. Remember, because we
// started numbering from 0, the index we want is 7.
dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;

DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton

dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;

// Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;

Notice that we put The Incredibles into the Array at index 3. What happens if we now run this next piece of code?


Because we just put Star Wars into the Array at index 3, The Incredibles is no longer in the Array. It has been overwritten!
If we still have the incrediblesDVD variable in scope, then the DVD still exists in the computer's memory. If not though, it's totally gone!

Reading Items from an Array
We can check what's at a particular Array index.
